# Proof of concept

A proof of concept is a small demonstration of a skill or capability that is indicative of your ability to complete a larger work using the same tools and techniques. If you struggle to complete a proof of concept for your intended project, you may need to rethink the scope of your work, or reduce the need for complex technical skills. A compelling project idea can be conveyed by being resourceful and adaptable in the production approach when faced with insurmountable technical obstacles.
