# Assessment:

**This course is pass/fail.**

The capstone project is a serious endeavor and has an appropriate level of consequences. DMD 300 is designed to prepare students to have success in this course and to meet the expectations work quality, writing quality, and presentation quality. Attention to detail is expected at the 400 level. However, it is up the student to "show up" for work so to speak. Students will be given a go/no-go assessment in DMD 300 at the end of the semester, indicating if the instructor thinks the student is ready to tackle a capstone project. Ideally, students will not pass DMD 300 if they are not ready for the capstone, but they may narrowly pass the course. A student who has passed DMD 300, but was not given a "go" for DMD 400 should seriously consider taking other courses to help improve in the identified areas for improvement before enrolling in DMD 400 capstone experience.

To pass the course, students must meet the capstone requirements. Students must **repeat** the course if:

- Student fails to produce an adequate project proposal by the deadline.
- Student does not check-in with mentors by deadlines
- Student does not deliver all properly formatted project deliverables
- Student faces unfortunate and unavoidable life crisis. While this is regrettable, the student must participate in the online exhibition to pass the course requirements. Students will not be allowed to participate if they do not complete the project deliverables and meet the deadlines.
