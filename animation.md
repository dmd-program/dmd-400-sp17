# Animation

Examples include 2D or 3D animations, motion graphics, traditional or VR  and game-based films. Time-based media must include the following in the production process:



## Example projects

* Short film
* Explainer animation
* Motion graphics \(bumper animations, commercials, titles\)
* Experimental
* VJ loops
* Projection mapping

## Proof of concept

The goal of an animation proof is to demonstrate that you can operate the necessary software and show that you can a strong grasp of animation principles. Choose one of the following based on your project interests:

1. **Traditional keyframe animation:** Demonstrate knowledge of keyframe animation and 12 principles by creating a few seconds of animation using a character or other content from your proposal concept. ToonBoom is the industry standard animation package, but others are acceptable.
2. **Motion design:** Create a few seconds of rendered animation using a 2D animation package like Adobe AfterEffects or 3D software such as Cinema 4D, Blender, Maya, or similar. You can also achieve motion design for the web using Adobe Animate CC.
3. **Short film:** Create an example animatic \(blocked animation\), animated character rig, or other animated asset relevant to your short film concept.
