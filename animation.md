# Animation projects

## Short film

Short films can sometimes be completed by one person over the course of multiple years, or by a team in a few short months. It is unusual for a short film to be quickly created by only one person, as there are many production requirements that take time to produce. If you would like to create a short film, consider assembling a team with complimentary skills.

### Production requirements

These are common production requirements for most short films, and may include more or less depending on the project. They can also occur in a slightly different order, but in general, if these steps are followed, you are more likely to produce a successful short film.

### Proof of concept

Create an example animatic \(blocked animation and sound\), animated character rig, or other animated asset relevant to your short film concept.

## Proof of concept

The goal of an animation proof is to demonstrate that you can operate the necessary software and show that you can a strong grasp of animation principles. Choose one of the following based on your project interests:

1. **Traditional keyframe animation:** Demonstrate knowledge of keyframe animation and 12 principles by creating a few seconds of animation using a character or other content from your proposal concept. ToonBoom is the industry standard animation package, but others are acceptable.
2. **Motion design:** Create a few seconds of rendered animation using a 2D animation package like Adobe AfterEffects or 3D software such as Cinema 4D, Blender, Maya, or similar. You can also achieve motion design for the web using Adobe Animate CC.
