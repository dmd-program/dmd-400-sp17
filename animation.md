# Animation projects

## Types of animation projects

1. Short film 
2. Explainer animation
3. Motion graphics \(bumper animations, commercials, titles\) 4. Experimental
5. VJ loops
6. Projection mapping
7. Web-based animation (HTML/CSS/Javascript)
8. Production requirements

**Note about animated short films:** Short films can often be one of the most compelling means of storytelling. They can sometimes be completed by one person over the course of multiple years, or by a skilled team in a few short months. It is unusual for a short film to be quickly created by only one person, as there are many production requirements that take time to produce. If you would like to create a short film, consider assembling a team with complimentary skills, or choose an animation process and style that can be rapidly produced if you are working solo. You can outsource pre- or post-production tasks and focus on your core production interest.

### Production requirements

These are common production requirements for most types of animations, and may include more or fewer depending on the project. They can also occur in different orders, but in general, if these steps are followed, you are more likely to produce a successful animation.

1. **Concept art**

### Proof of concept

Create an example animatic \(blocked animation and sound\), animated character rig, or other animated asset relevant to your short film concept.

## Proof of concept

The goal of an animation proof is to demonstrate that you can operate the necessary software and show that you can a strong grasp of animation principles. Choose one of the following based on your project interests:

1. **Traditional keyframe animation:** Demonstrate knowledge of keyframe animation and 12 principles by creating a few seconds of animation using a character or other content from your proposal concept. ToonBoom is the industry standard animation package, but others are acceptable.
2. **Motion design:** Create a few seconds of rendered animation using a 2D animation package like Adobe AfterEffects or 3D software such as Cinema 4D, Blender, Maya, or similar. You can also achieve motion design for the web using Adobe Animate CC.
