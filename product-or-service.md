# Product, service, UI/UX

## Types of product or service projects

* Functional mobile or web app
* High fidelity interactive mockups \(UI\)
* Speculative or discursive design projects
* Comprehensive user experience \(UX\) research
* Digital fabrication products or prototypes \(furniture, wearables, clothes, structures, etc.\) 

### Production requirements

* Primary and secondary research
* Design thinking and ideation
* Prototyping and production
  * Digital fabrication
    * 3D printing
    * Laser cutting
    * CNC Routing and milling
  * Traditional fabrication techniques
* User testing
* Real world testing
* Design analysis

### Proof of concept

The goal of a proof is to demonstrate that you can operate the necessary software and show that you have a strong grasp of relevant production principles.

Produce a basic example of a realtime project in your chosen software production pipeline that demonstrates you are capable of manipulating digital assets and code. This should be an exported runtime application compatible with Mac OS or Windows.
