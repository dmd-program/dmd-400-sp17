# Product, service, UI/UX

## Types of product or service projects

* Functional mobile or web app
* High fidelity interactive mockups \(UI\)
* Speculative or discursive design projects
* Comprehensive user experience \(UX\) research
* Digital fabrication products or prototypes \(furniture, wearables, clothes, structures, etc.\) 

### Production requirements

1. Research, design thinking, and ideation
  - [IDEO Design Kit](http://www.designkit.org/methods)
  - [Stanford D.School](https://dschool.stanford.edu/resources/the-bootcamp-bootleg)
  - [Universal Methods of Design: 100 Ways to Research Complex Problems, Develop Innovative Ideas, and Design Effective Solutions](https://www.amazon.com/Universal-Methods-Design-Innovative-Effective/dp/1592537561/)
2. Prototyping and production
  * CAD
    * [Rhino3D](https://www.rhino3d.com/) (recommended)
    * [SolidWorks](https://www.solidworks.com/)(free access to PSU students)
    * [AutoCad](https://www.autodesk.com/products/autocad/overview) (free education license available)
  * Non-CAD modelling
    * Blender, Autodesk Maya, Maxon C4D, Foundry Modo
  * Digital fabrication
    * 3D printing
    * Laser cutting
    * CNC Routing and milling
  * Web design and development
    * Tools: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Github](http://github.com)
    * 
3. Testing and analysis
  * User testing
  * Performance testing

### Proof of concept

The goal of a proof is to demonstrate that you can operate the necessary software and show that you have a strong grasp of relevant production principles.

Produce a basic example of a realtime project in your chosen software production pipeline that demonstrates you are capable of manipulating digital assets and code. This should be an exported runtime application compatible with Mac OS or Windows.
