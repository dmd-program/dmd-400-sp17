# Product, service, UI/UX


## Types of product or service projects

* Functional mobile or web app
* High fidelity interactive mockups \(UI\)
* Speculative or discursive design projects
* Comprehensive user experience \(UX\) research
* Digital fabrication products or prototypes \(furniture, wearables, clothes, structures, etc.\) 

**Note about design projects requiring fabrication equipment:** If you are interested in using PSU Main Campus fabrication equipment including laser cutters, 3D printers, CNC Routers, water-jet cutters, etc., you must coordinate a time to visit, complete requisite safety training in advance, and schedule time on required machines. Contact your professor for more information. It is often less expensive to pay for the object to be fabricated using an online service or local company rather than pay for travel and lodging.


### Production requirements

1. Research, design thinking, and ideation
  - [IDEO Design Kit](http://www.designkit.org/methods)
  - [Stanford D.School](https://dschool.stanford.edu/resources/the-bootcamp-bootleg)
  - [Universal Methods of Design: 100 Ways to Research Complex Problems, Develop Innovative Ideas, and Design Effective Solutions](https://www.amazon.com/Universal-Methods-Design-Innovative-Effective/dp/1592537561/)
2. Prototyping and production
  * CAD
    * [Rhino3D](https://www.rhino3d.com/) (recommended)
    * [SolidWorks](https://www.solidworks.com/)(free access to PSU students)
    * [AutoCad](https://www.autodesk.com/products/autocad/overview) (free education license available)
  * Non-CAD modelling
    * Blender, Autodesk Maya, Maxon C4D, Foundry Modo
  * Digital fabrication
    * [3D printing](https://www.shapeways.com)
    * [Laser cutting](https://sendcutsend.com)
    * Advanced fabrication: Routing, turning, and milling, water-jet cutting (using fabrication equipment requires proximity to PSU Main Campus and coordination with facility operators in advance)
  * Web design and development
    * Website dev tools and technology: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Github](http://github.com), [Git Pages Tutorial 1](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/), [Git Pages Tutorial 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWVjQsvQocA)
    * "App" tools and technology: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Github](http://github.com), [CodeSandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/dashboard/recent)
    * Everything list: [Extensive list of web tools and technology](https://free-for.dev/)
3. Testing and analysis
  * User testing
  * Performance testing

### Proof of concept

The goal of a proof is to demonstrate that you have a strong grasp of relevant research, design, fabrication, and development principles.

Produce a basic example of a project in your web technology or digital fabrication technology of choice that demonstrates you are capable of producing digital assets and code.
