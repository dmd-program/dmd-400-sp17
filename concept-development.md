# Concept development

A concept is a core idea (or set of ideas) that signify basic values, motivations and practices inherent in a project. A project lacking strong concept development tends to be shallow and without regard for cultural and community contexts, which will become apparent during discussion and critique. Projects based on a strong concept tend to be deemed

## Approaches

1. **Directed concept** 
  * Top-down approach
  * Process of deduction
  * Situating: This is a mapping process. An interpretation of outcomes of an inquiry will depend in part on the frame of reference of existing knowledge. What is known helps identify what is not. Situating is a method that opens up lines of inquiry commonly used to review literature and information sources in the public domain. Situating is a curatorial process for looking at existing things in new ways.
2. **Emerging concept**
  * Bottom up approach
  * Process of induction
  * Revealing: This is a discovery process. A core purpose of inquiry is to discover new knowledge or the possibility of thinking about things in new, innovative ways. To reveal something relies on others experiencing a change of awareness or understanding. Revealing, therefore is not only a method of discovery, but requires multiple ways of communicating to target groups and others.

## How to develop a good concept

Some key features of a good concept in the context of this course:

1. Novelty or unexpected combinations
2. Link to relevant cultural, historical, social contexts
3. Explore moral and ethical issues or quandaries
4. Aesthetic


Identifying issues and problem spaces


[Design thinking methods](/design-process-and-methods.md) and [Synectics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synectics) can be used to generate new, relevant, and thought-provoking concepts rather quickly. A design process that you might use to realize an art or design project could also be used to generate the concept itself since the principles are effectively the same; emphasize quick prototyping, testing, analysis, and iteration.
