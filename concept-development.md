# Concept development

A concept is a core idea \(or set of ideas\) that signify basic values, motivations and practices inherent in a project. A project lacking strong concept development tends to be shallow and without regard for cultural and community contexts, which will become apparent during discussion and critique. There are two typical concept development approaches. The _directed concept_ approach refers to when a concept is established and defined at the beginning stages of project development, and the _emerging concept_ approach is were the concept is allowed to emerge and evolve during the production of a project.

**Directed concept:**

* Top-down approach
* Process of deduction
* Situating: This is a mapping process. An interpretation of outcomes of an inquiry will depend in part on the frame of reference of existing knowledge. What is known helps identify what is not. Situating is a method that opens up lines of inquiry commonly used to review literature and information sources in the public domain. Situating is a curatorial process for looking at existing things in new ways.

**Emerging concept:**

* Bottom up approach
* Process of induction
* Revealing: This is a discovery process. A core purpose of inquiry is to discover new knowledge or the possibility of thinking about things in new, innovative ways. To reveal something relies on others experiencing a change of awareness or understanding. Revealing, therefore is not only a method of discovery, but requires multiple ways of communicating to target groups and others.

## How to develop a good concept

**Key features:**

1. Invention and/or unexpected combinations to produce novelty 
2. Link to relevant cultural, historical, social contexts
3. Explore moral and ethical issues or quandaries
4. Aesthetic and theoretical exploration

Design thinking methods can help you identify a concept. However, more often than not, your everyday observations are enough to spark an idea for a concept. It is helpful to keep a small notebook with you, or store a running list of ideas on a mobile device.
